# The CoffeeCherry Pi `pid`

This directory contains the codes and instructions for setting up the CoffeeCherry Pi to control boiler temperature using a pid system.

## CoffeeCherry Pi Dependencies

`smart`

## Bill of Materials

* Temperature sensor (RS Stock No. 133-0679) - any temperature sensor will do remember that a) it needs to be able to deal with high temperatures for steam mode (so 150 C or up) and the better the accuracy/resolution the more stable your boiler.
* M4 spacer (RS Stock No. 161-3636) - essentially we're stealing James' idea from this post http://int03.co.uk/blog/2014/04/16/replacing-the-gaggia-classic-coffee-thermostat-with-a-tsic-306/

Note: this assumes that you have a functioning Home Assistant server already running (and that you've already followed the dependency instructions).
